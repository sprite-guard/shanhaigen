# Shan Hai Gen

Shan Hai Jing, or The Classic of Mountains and Seas, is a very strange ancient
Chinese book, a sort of geography textbook with a scattering of mythological
creatures and folk-tales. It includes some beautiful passages, ranging from
short and simple descriptions of chimeric beasts to whole stories. I've had a
fascination with the book for many years, and my name "Sprite Guard" is taken
from one of its stories.

This year's NaPoGenMo seemed like a great opportunity to combine my love of the
book with my interest in generative text. The book's writing style is so simple
and formulaic that it seemed like a great model for my first non-trivial Tracery
project.
